# SRA_Temperatura
This is a project for university where I need to create an automatic temperature regulation system for the heat emitted by an incandescent bulb using an ATMega328P, with a menu displayed on a 2x16 LCD.

For the regulation I used a PID and the main purpose of the project is that the user can set via buttons the Temperature Target, the time it takes to reach that target, the time it need to stay at the targeted time and the time it takes to cool off.
